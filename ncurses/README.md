## Tested in ubuntu/mint, windows wsl+ubuntu ##

This is just a simple example of how to use ncurses with c++ and cmake
to build this project you will need cmake and a c++ compiler, after that
just do the following commands on the terminal, in the folder this README is located:

1. `mkdir build`
2. `cmake ..`
3. `cmake --build .`
4. Executable name is ncurses_test, just run it and have fun

## Notes about replit

Since ncurses is built along with this project, replit doesn't have enough CPU
to properly handle the build process, so it could take a anoying long time to build. 
There, maybe, we could just install the pre built binaries since it's a linux platform.
